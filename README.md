UX Design Day
=============
[beta.uxdesignday.org](http://beta.uxdesignday.org)

Source code for uxdesignday.org - static HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS.

### Dependencies

Uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/). I compile with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) which is pretty great, but any Coffeescript / Stylus compiler will do.

### Using Grunt

A Gruntfile with a `dev` task is available for development. Install the node prerequisites with `npm install` and run `grunt dev` to watch changes to CoffeeScript and Stylus files.
